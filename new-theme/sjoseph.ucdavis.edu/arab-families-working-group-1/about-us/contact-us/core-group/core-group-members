<p><span>Nadine Naber is an Associate Professor in Gender and Women's Studies and Asian American Studies at the University of Illinois, Chicago.  She received her Ph.D. in Socio-Cultural Anthropology from the University of California, Davis. Her research and teaching contribute to the field, Arab American Studies, by incorporating the methods and theories of Women of Color, Transnational, and Post-Colonial Feminist Studies. Her work utilizes ethnographic methods that allow for theorizing from lived experience. She has contributed a diasporic Arab feminist critique that approaches Arab American concepts of gender and sexuality at the nexus of a dynamic interplay between immigration, assimilation, racialization, and U.S. imperial formations. She has also developed feminist analyses of the changing realities of race, gender, and religion among Arab Americans before and after September 11th. Her current research focuses on the significance of family, gender, and sexuality to practices of diasporic nationalisms among Arab Americans in the context of homeland wars. Nadine Naber is co-founder of the Arab Women's Solidarity Association, North America (cyber AWSA); Arab Movement of Women arising for Justice (AMWAJ) and Arab Women’s Activist Network (AWAN) and actively engaged in INCITE!
