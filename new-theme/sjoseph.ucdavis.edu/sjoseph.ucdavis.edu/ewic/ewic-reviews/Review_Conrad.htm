            <p><strong>Reviewed By: Lawrence I. Conrad<br /> Review of Encyclopedia of Women and Islamic Cultures: Vol. 1: Methodologies,      Paradigms and Sources. <i><br /></i>Published by:<i> Der Islam </i>Vol 82, S. 201-205 (2005)<br /></strong><br /> In her introduction as general editor to this new encyclopedia, the anthropologist      Suad JOSEPH rightly describes it as “a project whose time has come”      (xlviii). There has been a dramatic expansion of women’s studies and      the study of gender issues since the beginning of the feminist movement in      the 1960s and 70s, and this has certainly been one of the major changes in      Middle East studies over the past 30 years. It is clearly time for a comprehensive      review and reflection on future prospects and options. This work arose from      a 1994 proposal by Peri Bearman, then at Brill, for an “Encyclopedia      of Women in Islam”. Over the next nine years a plan for a much smaller      work expanded into an encyclopedia of about four million words in six volumes,      directed by an editorial team of six scholars assisted by an advisory board      of 41 further academics representing many different fields and methodologies.      From the general editor’s introduction and the contents it is clear      that the work has been conceived on a vast global scale: it will consider      women in any context that can be described as “Islamic” in some      way; so, for example, there is coverage of Muslim women in China (120-28),      North America (192-96), and Western Europe (299-303). But the ambition of      the project extends far beyond matters of geography and thematic scope, for      the editors have more or less sought to reinvent the genre of the encyclopedia.      Arguing that such a work usually represents a positivist enterprise to stabilize      concepts in some authoritative way, they have rejected this program and instead      have sought “to destabilize concepts, complicate ideas, document the      ‘fuzziness’ of reality” (xxiv). Their encyclopedia seeks      to do this by devoting an introductory volume to “the examination of      the methodologies, paradigms, approaches, and resources available to study      women and Islamic cultures in different historical periods and in different      disciplines” (xxi); this will be followed by further volumes on: II,      Family, Law, Politics; III, Family, Body, Sexuality, and Health; IV, Economics,      Education, Mobility, and Space; V, Practices, Interpretations, and Representations;      and VI, a cumulative index. Within each volume entries will be arranged alphabetically,      but biographical entries are specifically excluded from the work. Unlike many      other encyclopedias, which often take many years to complete, this one is      apparently far advanced already, with all of the volumes scheduled for publication      within the next year or so. <br /><br /> The introductory volume under review here contains the general editor’s      extensive introduction, a section of thematic articles (1-303), another section      of disciplinary articles (305—443), and a bibliography of books and      articles in European languages published since 1993 (445—682). The thematic      entries comprise 46 articles on methodologies and sources in different historical      periods and regions with the aim of problematizing their subjects: authors      were asked to consider the main sources and research methods and thus to provide      critical tools for future study, and most immediately for use by authors preparing      the remaining volumes of the <i>EWIC</i>. The 22 disciplinary articles seek      to provide critical assessments of the various methodologies and disciplines      under whose auspices the subject of women and Islamic cultures are studied.      The Bibliography, a work unto itself really, was prepared by Geoffrey ROPER      and several colleagues. Elaborately subdivided and provided with its own indices      of names and subjects, it lists over 5000 books and articles published in      a single decade in this field or relevant to it in some immediate way. <br /><br /> It can hardly be doubted that this work will be seen as a landmark event in      the history of women’s studies with reference to Islamic cultures. The      articles are all quite well-written, and one can frequently see evidence of      the detailed collaboration to which the general editor frequently refers in      her introduction. Many of the bibliographies to the articles will be of immediate      and considerable benefit to readers interested in these topics. Though one      will need detailed indices in order to use the <i>EWIC</i> effectively (more      on this below), this volume does convey a useful idea of the resources that      are available for the subject and valuable critiques and evaluations on various      methodological issues. For European language studies the list of materials      compiled by ROPER and his colleagues is a state-of-the-art example of modern      bibliographical research. JOSEPH quite often alludes to the fact that the      vast scale of the project only gradually became apparent to the editors, and      one can well believe that. The <i>EWIC</i> can best be seen as a first attempt      to review and assess a field that has been growing in many different directions,      and more rapidly than many observers may have realized. There are, however,      a number of areas where the project can be seen as somewhat problematic, and      as there is to be an online version of the <i>EWIC</i>, the following comments      may be worth considering as the project proceeds past the printed book phase.      <br /><br /> First of all, JOSEPH repeatedly argues that the <i>EWIC</i> is a “feminist      project” and that it reflects a “feminist vision’. One editor      comments that the levels of commitment dedicated to the project reflect “what      women are willing to do for feminism” (xlviii). Elsewhere, however,      we read that feminism means different things to different participants and      that those writing for the EWIC have no unified view on the matter (xxxix,      xlvi). So in what sense is this a feminist undertaking? A work that is about      women and is largely written by women scholars is not necessarily feminist,      and knowing what feminist perspectives or agendas have shaped the work and      how is of considerable interest to the user of the EWIC. <br /><br /> The General Editor refers to the problem of allocating word assignments to      various sections and to individual articles, but her own introduction suggests      where part of the problem lies. This piece, crucial to the understanding and      proper use of the EWIC, is rambling and repetitive; matters that could have      been written up as a history of the project for a journal, for example, are      pursued at great length, and JOSEPH is given to citing endless specifics (dates,      amounts, numbers, who went where when and did what, etc). All this could most      usefully have been much reduced. The flood of unnecessary detail in fact serves      to obscure a number of genuinely important matters, such as the identification      of the feminist approach that the work reflects. The reader is also told that      one section will explain how to use the <i>EWIC</i> (xxi), but this task      is immediately lost sight of in the general editor’s enthusiastic explanation      of its structure. <br /><br /> As this work will be seen as authoritative in its field, greater attention      needs to be paid to matters of detail like transliteration and the proper      rendering of Arabic terms and book titles. Errors in the transliteration of      Arabic terms include the Arabic word for “woman”, which in one      chapter is consistently misrendered as <i>mar'a</i>. In a few cases a book      title has been so badly misrepresented that it cannot be read, and if in a      discussion of law an author reads masnad for musnad, this raises the question      of why that author is writing this article. And how could such matters have      escaped the attention of the editors? This is not a mere quibble, but reflects      a larger problem that in some cases articles have been written by scholars      who are not in any way authorities in that field, however worthy their contributions      may be in their own area of genuine expertise. In some cases it is striking      that obvious candidates for writing articles are missing, though naturally      it is not always possible for editors to enlist the participation of their      first choice for a topic. <br /><br /> One might also query the way in which the editors have set out to create a      new kind of encyclopedia on a vast scale. The proof is in the pudding, of      course, so one will have to wait until the entire work has appeared to assess      how successful this endeavor has been, but already there is some room for      reservations. JOSEPH calls into question the way in which encyclopedias usually      define and package concepts in some authoritative way, but that is precisely      what an encyclopedia, by its very nature, is meant to do, especially if it      is aimed at a general and student audience as well as specialized scholars.      Good authors will in any case convey the complexities of their topic and pay      attention to the pitfalls of viewing things from the center and ignoring regional      and temporal variations. <br /><br /> The editors’ concern for de-essentialing Islam, destabilizing received      notions, decentering the Middle East, and so on, has proceeded to such lengths      that even the inclusion of biographical entries on specific Muslim women has      been rejected. The stated reason for this is that the editors did not want      to focus on exceptional women doing unusual things; this is an “individuals      and history” approach that “distorts and misrepresents the lived      lives of the majority of women” (xlii—xliii; in a few exceptional      cases short biographies are given in boxes, cf. 44, 274, 279). We are advised      that on this the publisher gave only “reluctant agreement”, and      it is easy to see why — the argument is simply false. Does the biography      of Virginia Wolff misrepresent the lived lives of other English women of her      time? Hardly. A competent account would, on the contrary, reveal the enormous      difficulties that all women students faced in their efforts to be taken seriously      and advance based on their own merits, and would reveal something of the broader      difficulties faced by women in general. Apart from that, focus on the accomplished      individual is typical of traditional Islamic society everywhere and at all      times, as shown by the enormous attention lavished on biographical dictionaries,      to which two chapters are devoted in the <i>EWIC</i> (29—36), and      by the sharp focus on remarkable individuals in areas like literature, history,      and popular piety. For a work that claims to be especially attentive to the      trap of false and artificial paradigms that misrepresent Islamic culture,      this error is a very great one indeed. But it does save space for other items      on the very large agenda of the work. <br /><br /> Another dimension of this agenda is stated as preference for cultural and      civilizational matters over textual and doctrinal issues (xxxiv). This is      also untrue to the cultural values of traditional Islam, which was profoundly      engaged with matters of doctrine as revealed in important texts and in many      ways remains so today. One casualty here would appear to be the Qur’an      itself. Many users of the <i>EWIC</i> will rightly expect that great attention      would be paid to the Islamic scripture, since what the Qur’an has to      say about women has been enormously influential in Islamic societies over      the centuries. But there is no chapter on the Qur’an in the section      on sources and methodologies, and for information one must resort to Chapter      1, where attention is paid to the topic within the context of early Islamic      history. Here the problems that have arisen in both medieval and modern Islamic      discussions are elided away entirely, as if there have been no problems to      discuss. Behind the vague reference to a verse that “allows for a gender      hierarchization” (7), for example, lies Surat al-Nisa (4), v 34, which      in reality refers to a husband’s right to beat his wife and dismiss      her from his presence. What the reader needs on this subject would be, for      example, an account of the status of women in Muliammad’s time, what      the Qur’an has to say on the subject, how these verses have been interpreted,      how they have been elaborated upon in other fields (<i>hadith</i> and <i>fiqh</i>,      for example), and how they have figured in modern debates. <br /><br /> The vast scope of the <i>EWIC</i> is also problematic in that the desire      to include Muslim women wherever they may be found, even if not in an Islamic      culture, has resulted in a number of clearly more central subjects (more “central”      in that these are so important in Islamic cultures) being left out entirely.      What of music, for example? Women have played a leading role in that field      throughout Islamic history and in various parts of the Islamic world, and      the study of this music is difficult and complex. Or theology? Islamic theology      has much to say about women, and the writings of al-Ghaz1i, for example, are      especially rich in this area. This figure is briefly mentioned in the article      on philosophy (399—400), but is quickly dismissed, one suspects because      his views would be anathema to modern women. But these views were there, nonetheless,      and were extremely influential. And what of mysticism? Here one could refer      not only to views about women, but also to women participants (mythic and      historical) in mystical activities. Finally there is poetry, which receives      scattered attention, primarily in the chapter on literature (42—50).      In the various languages of the Islamic world there has been an enormous attention      to women in poetry of various kinds, and women have themselves been active      in this field from pre-Islamic times onward. <br /><br /> Attention should be drawn to the sources that underlie this volume of the      <i>EWIC</i>. Though some chapters make full use of the excellent modern      scholarship being produced in Arabic, Persian, Turkish, and other languages      of the Islamic world, such cases are in the minority and many chapters cite      works only in English and to a lesser extent other Western languages (interestingly      enough, in one chapter only works in Russian are listed: 118—19). In      some cases this is understandable in light of the dominant position of English      in those fields. But in many other cases excellent scholarship in languages      of the Islamic world is simply ignored. The Bibliography continues this trend.      While it is stated from the outset that works in these languages should not      be ignored, it is claimed that it has not been possible to include such studies      in this bibliography (447). Why not? <br /><br /> Finally, for such a broadly conceived work that is bound to be complex and      difficult to use, the index is entirely inadequate. Professional standards      of indexing suggest that a good index should be about a tenth of the size      of the book it covers, and insist that long strings of numbers must be avoided      — such strings reveal places where sub-entries need to be provided.      The index to <i>EWIC</i> I is very short in comparison to the size of the      volume, many important items have been missed out entirely, and quite a few      entries bear long lists of page numbers. The indices to the Bibliography are      far superior to those for the volume itself. <br /><br /> In sum, the EWIC is certainly a work for which there is a specific need, and      what JOSEPH and her colleagues are producing will undoubtedly be of great      value. At the same time, it is a first attempt in a rapidly growing field      and perhaps illustrates how a worthy undertaking nurtured by unlimited enthusiasm      can take on a life of its own. What we have here is an encyclopedia on a specific      topic that, when complete, will be about half the size of the Encyclopedia      of Islam and yet still reveal significant gaps and shortcomings. <br /><br /> Hamburg, Lawrence I.
