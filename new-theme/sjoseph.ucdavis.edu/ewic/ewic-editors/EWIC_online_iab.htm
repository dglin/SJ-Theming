<p>Bahar Davary is an Associate Professor of Theology and Religious Studies at the University of San Diego and affiliate faculty of the Ethnic Studies department. She received her Ph.D. from the Catholic University of America in Catholic Theological Tradition and Muslim-Christian Dialogue and M.A. and B.A. in History of Religion and Islamic Theology from University of Tehran. Her research interests are: Qur’an and its interpretations, Women in Islam, and Muslim-Christian Dialogue. Her research on women in classical interpretations of the Qur’an, examines selected works of Tafsir, focusing on the development, continuity, and change in the portrayal of woman throughout Islamic history and the ways in which the commentaries affect the self-perception of Muslim women. In “Miss Elsa and the Veil: Shame, Honor, and Identity Negotiations” she looks at the theme of women as the “gendered other,” but more specifically i.e. the “veiled other.” Her research takes on a comparative approach between Christian and Islamic feminist thought pointing to similarities and differences in their approaches to their respective textual tradition. She has participated in research projects in Turkey and Iran on the to explore the variety of meanings of the veil as a religious symbol and its place in the consciousness of Turkish and Iranian Muslim women. Her research in Southeast Asia focuses on ecology and its relation with the sacred and with the feminine. Davary has served on the board of editors for the Companion Encyclopedia of the Qur’an (Routledge, 2006), was an external Consultant on Islam for the Center for the Study of Catholic Social Thought, at Duquesne University, Pittsburgh, PA (2007-2011) and is currently (2011-) serving on the advisory board of the Kroc Institute for Peace and Justice. In the past years she has taught courses, including: World Religions, Islam, Gender and Islam, Muslim Women in Literature, Ecology and the Sacred, and Islamic Mysticism. She has team-taught study abroad course Negotiating Religious Diversity in India; Honors course Women in Islam and Confucianism, and World Religion and Theatre.</p>
